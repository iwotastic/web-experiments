            We use web browsers all the time, most of us probably interact with one multiple times every single day,
            but what does your web browser tell about <i>you?</i> Step right up and click the button below to find out
            what your web browser can tell about you, and more importantly what power this could give the sites you
            use every day.

        <div class="c2a">

                In the time that it took from you clicking the button above to this text appearing on your screen, a
                script ran and determined the following information about your browser, computer, and possibly you...
            </p>
            <p>
                You are using <span id="browser"></span> on a device running <span id="os"></span>, with a screen that
                is <span id="width"></span> pixels by <span id="height"></span> pixels in size. Additionally, you have
                this window <span id="window-status"></span>, which probably means that
                <span id="window-status-expl"></span>. You also probably <span id="bookmarks"></span> the bookmarks bar
                visible. Finally, it would appear that you have a <span id="gpu"></span> graphics card in your computer.
            </p>
            <div class="c2a">
                <button id="how-btn">How Did You Do That<i>?</i></button>

        <div id="how" class="hide">

                The script that ran when you clicked on the first button analyzed information that your browser provides
                freely for various features that may identify information about you. These features include: the kinds
                of things your web browser supports doing, data about your screen size, and some data about how your
                browser creates graphics. By correlating these features with known values for each browser and OS, this
                site can figure out what browser and OS you are using and various information about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the purpose of being an unessay, I intentionally limited the number of features I wanted to analyze.
                However, websites that make use browser fingerprinting will generally use way more features in a way
                that allows them to uniquely identfiy your browser even if you clear your cookies or turn on "Incognito
                Mode."

                To see how far trackers and advertisers can go, check out
                <a target="_blank" href="https://amiunique.org/">amiunique.org</a> and
                <a target="_blank" href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">the EFF's Cover Your Tracks website</a>.
                These two sites use way more metrics and features and can give you a detailed explanation of whether
                your web browser is or is not unqiue.
